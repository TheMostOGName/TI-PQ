# TI-PQ
A port of Progress Quest for TI Calculators

This is written very very badly because tibasic is not really a great language. I added a second verison of the file with comments about what I was trying to do.

Only works with calcuators that a height of 10 lines, although it probably could be easily modified to less if needed. I wasn't able to test this that much, so I'm not sure if it works entirely or not.
